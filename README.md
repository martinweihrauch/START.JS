START.JS is a simple JavaScript framework, which eases the start of learning programming. With START.JS, the learning curve
is not as steep as without it. With START.JS, you do not need to have knowledge of HTML, CSS to program your first program.
As web programming has the advantage that you do not need a compiler, expensive or complex IDEs, but only a simple browser, 
it is an ideal starting point for beginners. However, having to juggle HTML, CSS and JavaScript (especially with this 
reading out HMTL elements or manipulating them), it can easily scare away the beginner. With START.JS, a lot of these 
complex things are smoothed out. After mastering the first projects and understanding JavaScript to some extent, the programmer
can then slowly increase his knowledge at his/her own pace by adding HTML and CSS and more like JQUERY, AngularJS or whatever.
